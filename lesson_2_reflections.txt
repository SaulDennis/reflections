What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
R: Git creates a new folder named .git that contains all data required for git. It is needed by your project for keeping track about all changes
made in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
R: The staging area is where you place the files in your working directory that want to commit
to the repository. It helps us to make logically separated commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
R: I could use the command git status to identify the files that are in the staging area 
and then the command git diff --staged to check the differences between the last commit
and the changes for being commited.
